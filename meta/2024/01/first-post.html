      <p>
        I'm making a first little text post here. It's almost 1am for me now in
        the early hours of January 19th. I'm hoping this will turn into
        something useful for me. Naturally, I've spent many more hours focusing
        on getting the general "website functionality" going, rather than
        actually making content. I'll have to see if this raw HTML/Javascript
        approach works out or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code structure feels pretty brittle right now, but I hope to prove
        myself wrong! I currently ahve absolutely nothing going on in the
        right-hand panel, and no working home page. Something I can resolve
        later hopefully!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm glad that I have this working, hopefully I make more pages
        at some point.
