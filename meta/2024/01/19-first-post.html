        <p>
          I'm making a first little text post here. It's almost 1am for me now in
          the early hours of January 19th. I'm hoping this will turn into
          something useful for me. Naturally, I've spent many more hours focusing
          on getting the general "website functionality" going, rather than
          actually making content. I'll have to see if this raw HTML/Javascript
          approach works out or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code structure feels pretty brittle right now, but I hope to prove
          myself wrong! I currently have absolutely nothing going on in the
          right-hand panel, and no working home page. Something I can resolve
          later hopefully!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I'm glad that I have this working, hopefully I make more pages
          at some point.
